# 🏋️‍♀️ Women Fitness EDA  

This project explores daily fitness data from women using Fitbit trackers. The dataset includes steps, calories burned, and activity minutes. The goal is to uncover insights into daily activity patterns and energy expenditure.

## 📊 Key Questions & Insights  

1. **Calories by Weekday vs Weekend**  
   - Women burn **similar calories across most days**.  
   - This may suggest that while men often rest more on weekends, women still maintain activity levels through household chores or errands.  

2. **Steps vs Calories Correlation**  
   - A **clear positive relationship** exists between step count and calories burned.  
   - More movement = more energy expenditure, reinforcing the importance of daily activity.  

3. **Very Active Minutes Distribution**  
   - Most women spend **under 30 minutes per day** in high-intensity activity.  
   - Highlights the challenge of maintaining consistent vigorous exercise.
